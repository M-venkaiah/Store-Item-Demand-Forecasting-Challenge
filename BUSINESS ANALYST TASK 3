INTERNSHIP TASKS:

To complete the Store Sales Prediction project, we will focus on understanding the business problem, data preparation, univariate and bivariate analysis, and implementing machine learning models, including ARIMA for time series analysis. Here's a structured approach:

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Business Problem Understanding
Objective:

Predict future sales for a company's store chain.
Identify key factors influencing sales performance.
Provide actionable insights to optimize inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies.
Key Questions:

What are the current sales trends?
Which factors most significantly impact store sales?
How can we accurately forecast future sales?
What strategies can be implemented to improve sales performance?
Data Preparation
Data Collection:

Gather data from sales records, store information, promotions, holidays, and other relevant sources.
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates and irrelevant records.
Handle missing values using appropriate methods (imputation, deletion, etc.).
Ensure data types are consistent and correct (dates, numerical values, categorical values).
Data Structuring:

Organize data into relevant tables or datasets with clear attribute definitions (e.g., store ID, date, sales, promotions, holidays).
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
Univariate Analysis:

Analyze individual features to understand their distribution and identify any anomalies.

Example in Python:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('store_sales_data.csv')

# Sales distribution
sns.histplot(df['sales'], kde=True)
plt.title('Sales Distribution')
plt.show()

# Sales by store type
sns.boxplot(x='store_type', y='sales', data=df)
plt.title('Sales by Store Type')
plt.show()
Bivariate Analysis:

Analyze the relationship between pairs of variables to identify correlations and potential redundancy.

Example in Python:

python
Copy code
# Correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

# Sales vs. promotions
sns.scatterplot(x='promotions', y='sales', data=df)
plt.title('Sales vs. Promotions')
plt.show()

# Sales over time
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
df['sales'].plot()
plt.title('Sales Over Time')
plt.show()
Machine Learning Models
Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary (e.g., rolling averages, lag features for time series analysis).
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate models for sales prediction, including ARIMA for time series analysis and other regression models for cross-sectional data.
ARIMA Time Series Model:

1. Time Series Decomposition:
Decompose the time series data to understand its components (trend, seasonality, and residuals).

Example in Python:

python
Copy code
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

result = seasonal_decompose(df['sales'], model='additive', period=12)
result.plot()
plt.show()
2. ARIMA Model:
Fit the ARIMA model to the time series data.

Example in Python:

python
Copy code
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Define the model
model = ARIMA(df['sales'], order=(5,1,0))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Summary of the model
print(model_fit.summary())

# Forecasting
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=12)
plt.plot(forecast)
plt.title('Sales Forecast')
plt.show()
Other Regression Models:

Implement other regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting for cross-sectional data analysis.

Example in Python:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Feature selection
X = df[['store_type', 'promotions', 'holiday', 'store_size']]
y = df['sales']

# One-hot encoding for categorical variables
X = pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
